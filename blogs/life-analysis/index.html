    <h2>🎯 The Pressure of “Plans”</h2>
    <p>It all starts with the guilt of not knowing when my parents ask, “What’s your plan after college?” I don’t roll my eyes. I don’t get annoyed. I just feel guilty. Guilty because I don’t have a neat answer ready—something that makes me sound sure, ambitious, and ahead of the game. But the truth is, I’m excellent at many things, but outstanding at none. I can code, present, think creatively, work with people… but none of these scream, “This is it. This is what I’m meant to do.”</p>
    
    <p>And that’s unsettling. It feels like I’m living life on autopilot—waking up, doing what’s required, and yes, enjoying small things like food and random moments—while secretly wishing I knew what bigger thing I was moving toward. Sometimes I feel like I'm living in the comparison zone. The hardest part isn’t not knowing—it’s watching others who seem like they do. Friends are building apps, running startups, preparing for MBAs, signing up for competitive exams—and I sit there wondering:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Am I falling behind?</li>
      <li>Am I wasting my potential?</li>
      <li>Or am I just on a different timeline?</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>💡 Potential and Paradox</h2>
    <p>Meanwhile, people tell me I have “a lot of potential.” Professors, friends, seniors, even random people say it. But if I can’t see it, feel it, or use it… does it even count?</p>
    
    <p>Life is already a paradox, and here we are surrounded by the silent pressure of society. Society treats 21 like a checkpoint. College should be done. Career should be mapped. Dreams should be clear. Marriage plans should be on the horizon. But life doesn’t work that neatly—and deep down, I think most people know that. And to escape that, we keep putting a tag of “forever young” on ourselves. Still, the pressure exists. It seeps into conversations, social media posts, and late-night thoughts. It makes you question yourself—not because you’re lazy or unmotivated, but because you don’t yet have a clear “why.”</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>⏳ Fear of Regret</h2>
    <p>And then comes the fear of regret. I don’t have any regrets (not yet at least) and I don’t want them either. Sometimes, I wonder—what if I wake up five years from now and realize I wasted my twenties? What if this period of “not knowing” becomes permanent?</p>
    
    <p>But then I think—maybe it’s not about having a perfect plan. Maybe it’s about doing something. Small things. Big things. Things that teach me what I like—and what I don’t. Because action, even in tiny doses, is the only way to figure things out. In short: EXPLORE.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🚀 Experiment, Learn, Repeat</h2>
    <p>I believe the right question isn’t “What’s your plan?” but “What do you want to try next?” Because clarity doesn’t come from sitting still—it comes from experimenting, failing, adjusting, and trying again. Time is flying fast and I might not know my final destination yet (not the movie one) but I know this:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>I’m not lazy (tini-tiny lazy maybe).</li>
      <li>I’m not lost.</li>
      <li>I’m learning who I am through every project, every idea, every conversation where I show up and give my best.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Little words of affirmation since this blog went a little deep than usual: One day, I’ll do something amazing. Maybe not today, maybe not next month—but it will happen. Until then, I’ll keep moving. I’ll keep doing something—something small, something bold, something different—because little actions beat big regrets. Everything will be fine. Not because I have it all figured out, but because I’m learning to trust the process. And sometimes… that’s enough to keep going.</p>
